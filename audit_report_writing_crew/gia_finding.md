**Unauthorized Access to Systems and Confidential Information Protection**

The audit finding reveals that company employees are not taking necessary measures to protect confidential information, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data. This deviation from Central Bank regulation no 123, which requires strict control over system access and protection of confidential information, has resulted in an elevated risk of data breaches, compromised security, and potential reputational damage.

The lack of protection measures in place poses a significant risk to the organization, as employees are not adhering to established protocols and procedures. This issue is rooted in inadequate training on data protection and cybersecurity best practices, which has led to a culture of complacency regarding confidential information handling.

**Risks:** The absence of effective controls to safeguard confidential information and prevent unauthorized system access exposes the organization to a range of risks, including:

• Data breaches
• Intellectual property theft
• Loss of customer trust

Furthermore, non-compliance with Central Bank regulation no 123 may result in penalties, fines, and reputational damage.

**Management Action:** To mitigate these risks, management should implement measures to ensure that all employees understand the importance of protecting confidential information and adhering to established protocols for system access. This can be achieved by:

• Providing regular training sessions on data protection and cybersecurity best practices
• Conducting regular audits to monitor compliance with Central Bank regulation no 123
• Implementing a robust incident response plan to quickly respond to potential breaches

By addressing this issue, the organization can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to systems and confidential information, minimize potential reputational damage, and maintain trust with customers.
