Title: Non-adherence to Competitive Bidding Process in Procurement Contracts

Finding: The audit uncovered 15 procurement contracts, collectively valued at over $2 million, that were awarded without following the requisite competitive bidding process. These agreements were negotiated directly with suppliers and lacked documentation justifying the bypassing of the bidding procedure. This practice contravenes the company's policy which necessitates contracts surpassing $100,000 to undergo a fair and open competitive bidding process aimed at achieving cost-effectiveness, ensuring compliance with internal controls, and maintaining procedural fairness.

Risks: The absence of competition in these contracts may potentially lead to overpricing or the selection of lesser quality vendors, causing unnecessary expenses for the organization. Furthermore, this non-compliance poses a threat to the company's reputation and may expose it to potential legal ramifications if discovered to be violating regulations or industry standards.

Management Action: To minimize these risks, management should initiate and enforce a comprehensive system that ensures all contracts over $100,000 strictly adhere to the competitive bidding process. This system should encompass proper documentation and approval mechanisms for any exceptions to this procedure. Moreover, regular reviews of procurement practices are advisable to promptly identify and address non-compliance issues.
