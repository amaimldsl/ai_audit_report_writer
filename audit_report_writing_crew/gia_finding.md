Title: Noncompliance with Competitive Bidding for Significant Procurement Contracts

Finding: The audit discovered that 15 procurement contracts, valued collectively over $2 million, were awarded without pursuing the necessary competitive bids as mandated by company policy. These contracts were negotiated directly with vendors, lacking justification for deviating from the bidding process.

Risks: This lapse in the procurement process could potentially lead to increased costs, potential conflicts of interest, and noncompliance with internal policies and external regulations. Such occurrences might result in financial losses, damage to reputation, and legal ramifications for the organization.

Management Action: To counteract these risks, management should establish a centralized procurement system that guarantees all contracts surpassing the specified threshold are subjected to competitive bidding. Documentation of any exceptions from this process, accompanied by senior management approval, is essential to maintain compliance and fortify internal controls. Regular audits should be carried out to monitor adherence to the policy and ensure procurement activities remain transparent, fair, and cost-effective.
