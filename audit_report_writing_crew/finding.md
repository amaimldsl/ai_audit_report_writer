Title: Lack of Compliance in Procurement Process â€“ Bypassing Competitive Bidding for Major Contracts

Finding: The audit identified that 15 procurement contracts, valued at over $2 million, were awarded without obtaining the required competitive bids. These contracts were directly negotiated with vendors without documenting any justification for bypassing the bidding process, which contradicts the company's procurement policy mandating that contracts exceeding $100,000 must undergo a competitive bidding process to ensure fairness, cost-effectiveness, and compliance with internal controls. Any deviation from this process must be properly documented and approved by senior management.

Risks: This gap in the procurement process may lead to excessive costs, potential conflicts of interest, and noncompliance with internal policies and external regulations, which could result in financial losses, reputational damage, and legal consequences for the organization.

Management Action: To mitigate these risks, management should implement a centralized procurement system that ensures all contracts above the specified threshold undergo a competitive bidding process. Additionally, proper documentation of any deviations from this process, along with senior management approval, should be mandatory to maintain compliance and enhance internal controls. Furthermore, regular audits should be conducted to verify compliance and ensure that procurement activities are transparent, fair, and cost-effective.
