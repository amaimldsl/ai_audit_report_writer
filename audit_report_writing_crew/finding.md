**Title:** Unauthorized Access to Systems and Confidential Information Protection

**Finding:** The lack of protection measures in place to safeguard confidential information and unauthorized access to systems by company employees poses a significant risk to the organization. Employees are not adhering to established protocols and procedures, resulting in unapproved and unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data. This deviation from Central Bank regulation no 123, which requires strict control over system access and protection of confidential information, has led to an elevated risk of data breaches, compromised security, and potential reputational damage.

**Risks:** The absence of effective controls to safeguard confidential information and prevent unauthorized system access exposes the organization to a range of risks, including data breaches, intellectual property theft, and loss of customer trust. Furthermore, non-compliance with Central Bank regulation no 123 may result in penalties, fines, and reputational damage.

**Management Action:** The management should implement measures to ensure that all employees understand the importance of protecting confidential information and adhering to established protocols for system access. This can be achieved by providing regular training sessions on data protection and cybersecurity best practices, conducting regular audits to monitor compliance with Central Bank regulation no 123, and implementing a robust incident response plan to quickly respond to potential breaches.

I hope this meets the expected format!
