Title: Non-Compliance with Competitive Bidding Process in Procurement Contracts

Finding: The audit identified that 15 procurement contracts, valued at over $2 million, were awarded without obtaining the required competitive bids. These contracts were directly negotiated with vendors without documenting any justification for bypassing the bidding process. This deviation contradicts the company's procurement policy that mandates contracts exceeding $100,000 must undergo a competitive bidding process to ensure fairness, cost-effectiveness, and compliance with internal controls.

Risks: The lack of competition in these contracts may lead to overpricing or the selection of suboptimal vendors, which could result in increased costs for the organization. Moreover, this non-compliance poses a risk to the company's reputation and may expose it to potential legal issues if it is found to be in violation of regulations or industry standards.

Management Action: To mitigate these risks, management should establish and implement a robust system to ensure that all contracts exceeding $100,000 adhere to the competitive bidding process. This system should include proper documentation and approval procedures for any deviations from this process. Additionally, periodic reviews of procurement practices should be conducted to identify and address any non-compliance issues promptly.
